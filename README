Renux version 0.2

Renux is a Linux distribution based on Debian and aim at embedded systems, originally created for TI's ARM based OMAP3 platforms. Renux aims to be a small size, up to date, distribution featuring a recent kernel version, a small filesystem and a graphical QT environment for development of grafical interfaces.

It is currently being tested on the Beagleboard, the Beagleboard-xM and Gumstix Overo development boards. More platforms might be added in the future.

Renux is developed by Robert Ã…kerblom-Andersson (Scorpiion) but if other people want to help out they are welcomed.
