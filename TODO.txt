Todo list for Renux:

* Fix so the user only have to type it's password once, now sometimes it you have to do it again if sudo have timed out
* Fix so that all parameter work for createRenux.bash
* Check if "build-dep gcc-4.5" is really needed? Maybe it can be removed as dependency.
* Check what kernel setting it is that makes Beagleboard to fail to reboot? (something with MUX is suspected)
