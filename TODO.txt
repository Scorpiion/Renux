Todo list for Renux:

* Fix so the user only have to type it's password once, now sometimes it you have to do it again if sudo have timed out
* Fix so that all parameter work for createRenux.bash
* Check if "build-dep gcc-4.5" is really needed? Maybe it can be removed as dependency.
* Check what kernel setting it is that makes Beagleboard to fail to reboot? (something with MUX is suspected)
* Check user premissions of generated files, the ownership of all files in "armel-squeeze-rootfs" are given to the $USER in the build script, to avoid having to be root to edit some files, but maybe some files has to be owned by root, otherwise it does not work well later when the new system is running and files are owned by a 100x user id, instead of root's id that is always the same.

* Move:
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
  from "createRenux.bash" into RenuxKernel "buldKernel.bash" script
